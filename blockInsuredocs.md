## BLOCK INSURE

### WHAT IS BLOCK INSURE?
	Numerous users have been left without compensation for their losses as a result of the hundreds of DeFi hacks that have occurred over the past two years, costing billions of dollars. 

	Block Insure is a decentralized insurance platform developed with user protection in mind to ensure that users are covered/compensated in the event of DeFi hacks.
    Users of projects whose credibility are staked can purchase insurance cover on Block Insure to guard against losses in the event of an exploit. If an exploit occurs, the funds staked for the project and the covers purchased are given to all those who purchased cover and request claim on their insurance as compensation for their losses.

#### WHO IS A RISK ASSESSOR?
	A risk assessor is one who creates stake for a protocol. Cresting a stake for a protocol on Block Insure is placing a stake on the reliability of a protocol that has passed a security audit. The risk assessor is the same as the first risk provider. 

#### WHAT IS RISK LEVEL?
	The risk level represents the chance of the protocol being compromised. In other words, the risk level is determined by the probability of the protocol being breached.
    There are five different risk levels measured by severity: very low, low, medium, high, and very high. The risk level of every protocol is set by its Risk Assessor. 
    The risk level of a protocol determines the total cover a user can purchase.

> 	cover = ((RISK_LEVEL + 25) * (_coverPeriod * _coverAmount))/ ((PERCENTAGE) * YEAR)


#### CREATING STAKE FOR PROTOCOLS
	Passing in the protocol name, protocol domain, total amount of cover to be staked for the protocol, and the risk level, a risk assessor creates a stake on a protocol. It is important to note that on Block Insure, it is possible to create another on an already staked protocol. 

#### PURCHASING COVER
	Users of any protocol staked on Block Insure can buy insurance cover for security in the event of a breach on the protocol.
    To buy cover, the user states the period of time over which they wish to hold the cover and the amount they wish to pay for the cover.
    It is imperative to note that the percentage amount of cover a user can purchase is determined by the risk level of the protocol.

#### COVER CLAIMING PROCESS
	In the case of a protocol being compromised, users would want to their insurance cover. The claim process goes through two (2) stages: Request Cover and Claim Cover. 
	
#### REQUEST COVER
    Giving the reason for claiming cover, a user makes request for insurance cover. This request is submitted to the DAO for reviewal, vote, and approval. The members of the DAO have a maximum of two (2) days to vote on request cover claims.

#### CLAIM COVER
    If the user’s request gets the minimum required votes, the user can claim their cover as compensation for the loss experienced as a result of the compromise. However, if the request is not approved by the DAO, the user will not be able to claim the cover and the funds can only be withdrawn by the risk assessor.



### INSURE-LABS GOVERNANCE DAO
	The Governance DAO is the decentralized organization responsible for reviewing and approving or disapproving claim requests on Block Insure. The activities of the Governance body are completely decentralized.

#### JOINING THE DAO
	Anyone interested in joining the Block Insure Governance DAO must meet the minimum or maximum amount of tokens deposit required. 
    The amount of tokens deposited determines the voting power of every member. The vote power determines the weight of a members vote on requests.
    >It is calculated thus:
	>
    >VotePower = (joinAmount * 1e6)/DAOMinimumAmount.
#### VOTING ON REQUEST COVER CLAIM
	When a claim request is submitted to the DAO, the members of the DAO have a maximum of two (2) days from the moment of submission to review, vote and approve or disapprove the request. After two days, it becomes impossible to vote on the request.
    No member of the DAO can vote on a submitted claim request more than once.

#### LEAVING THE DAO
	No member of the DAO can leave the DAO less than 30 days after joining the DAO.
